# Simple static website for discordless.com

Feel free to open PR's and help "developing" it by adding more altyernatives and fixing wrong information

## localhost

```
npm i
```

```
npm run dev
```

## IMPORTANT

Yes this website was 100% vibecoded (if you didn't realize already by the design), because I wanted to host it ASAP and I think it's enough as it is since I share it on X and don't aim for it to be seen from search engines like Google, but if someone wants to change that, feel free to make PR with changes!

# HOW TO EDIT DATA

all informations about alternatives are in src/data/alternatives.ts

make changes to that file freely and submit pull requests, that way I can still improve UI easily while you submit changes to raw information
